# Agentic Trust - Agent Explorer

## 🛡️ Agentic Trust

ERC-8004 provides a standardized way to create, manage, and authenticate autonomous agent identities on Ethereum, building on the **ERC-8004 Trustless Agents** specification.

ERC-8004 v1 is almost a complete re-write from v0.8 released early september.  Identity Registry went to an ERC-271 NFT, and Reputation Registry changed to storing Feedback online and changing to a signed FeedbackAuth Delegation with NFT Operator Scope.

Extended ERC-8004 v1 Reputation Feedback with Trust Graph

Each agent identity maintains a TrustGraph capturing agent atom relationships.  OpenAI builds a relationship driven trust between client agent and server agent based on client intent.



### 🔍 Explorer View of ERC-8004

Just as **EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service)** serves as an explorer and interface for Ethereum Attestations, **EAIS** functions as the **Explorer View of ERC-8004 Trustless Agents**. This web application provides a comprehensive interface for discovering, managing, and interacting with registered agents on the Ethereum blockchain.

### 🏗️ Core Features

* **ERC-8004 Identity Registry**  
Agents are registered in a decentralized **Identity Registry**, each receiving an immutable `agentId`.  This makes agents universally discoverable and verifiable across the agent economy.

* **ERC-8004 Reputation Registry**  
Feedback Review are stored in the **Reputation Registry**.  Trust score is derived from client intent and server agent Trust Graph.

* **Web3Auth Embedded Wallet, Bundler, and Paymaster.  Simplified UI with zero gas or auth popups**
User never see's a traditional ethereum wallet UI engagagement for creating EOA, creating Account Abstraction, creating an ENS entry/Wrapped NFT/reverse looking, and Delegations.  All gas fees are covered by paymaster. 


* **Multi-Agent Management via Account Abstraction (ERC-4337)**  
EAIS leverages **Account Abstraction (AA)** to let a single embedded wallet manage multiple agents. Each registered agent is automatically assigned its own **dedicated AA smart account**, giving it isolated signing authority and preventing exposure of the primary EOA.

* **Automated Agent Card Generation**  
With each registration, EAIS generates a standards-compliant `agent-card.json` file placed under the agent's `.well-known` directory. This file encodes the registry fields and includes a cryptographic signature, ensuring that agents can prove their identity and origin when interacting with others.

* **ENS Integration & Subdomain Management**  
Built-in support for **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)** integration, allowing agents to claim human-readable subdomains under parent ENS domains. Features include reverse lookup, subdomain creation, and seamless identity resolution.

* **Scalable & Secure by Design**  
Developers can seamlessly onboard organizations or services, roll out multiple agents under one wallet, and enable them to transact, verify credentials, and build reputation — all anchored on Ethereum.


👉 In essence: **EAIS + ERC-8004 + ERC-4337** enables a decentralized, secure, and scalable identity layer for the emerging agent economy on Ethereum.

### 🔐 Delegated Authority Architecture

The EAIS system implements a sophisticated delegation model that enables secure reputation management across the agent ecosystem:

* **Agent AA (Account Abstraction)**: Each registered agent receives its own dedicated smart account that can sign transactions and manage its identity. This provides isolated signing authority and prevents exposure of the primary wallet.

* **Owning EOA (Externally Owned Account)**: A single EOA can own and manage multiple Agent AAs, creating a hierarchical structure where one wallet controls numerous agent identities. This enables organizations to deploy multiple agents under unified management.

* **Session AA Delegation**: The owning EOA can delegate specific authority to a **Session AA** for reputation management operations. This Session AA is specifically authorized to accept feedback and manage reputation data on behalf of the Agent AA.

* **dApp Integration**: Applications can interact with the Session AA to submit feedback and reputation updates, while the Agent AA maintains its core identity and operational capabilities. This separation ensures that reputation management doesn't interfere with the agent's primary functions.

This delegation model provides **granular permission control**, **scalable agent management**, and **secure reputation handling** while maintaining the integrity of each agent's identity and operational boundaries.



## Quick start

```bash
# 1) Set env
cp .env.example .env

# ensure correct pnpm version (optional but recommended)
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@9.7.0 --activate

# remove potentially broken installs and caches
rm -rf node_modules apps/*/node_modules apps/*/.next
rm -f pnpm-lock.yaml

# fresh install at the workspace root
pnpm install


# run agent indexer
pnpm dev:indexer

# run agent services
pnpm --filter identity-service dev


# run explorer
pnpm dev:web


```

Open http://localhost:3000.

## Specification

Implements: [ERC-8004: Trustless Agents](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004)  
_Status: Draft (Standards Track: ERC)_

[![Spec: ERC-8004](https://img.shields.io/badge/spec-ERC--8004-blue)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004)


See **WSL setup** in this README for recommended steps on Windows Subsystem for Linux.


## IPFS/Web3.Storage Service (Optional Backend)

A lightweight Express service is included to handle Web3.Storage uploads/downloads and a few OAuth helper callbacks.

- Location: `apps/identity-service/service.js`

### Configure

Create an env file (example values):

```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=...
GCLOUD_BUCKET_NAME=...

# Web3.Storage (optional but recommended)
WEB3_STORAGE_EMAIL=you@example.com
WEB3_STORAGE_SPACE_DID=did:key:...

# OAuth (optional)


Place it where you launch the service (e.g., repo root or use a process manager that loads env).

### Run

```
node apps/identity-service/service.js
```

Defaults to port `4000`. Endpoints:

- `POST /api/web3storage/upload` { data, filename? } → { cid, url }
- `GET /api/web3storage/download/:cid` → { data }
- `POST /api/web3storage/credentials/save` { credentials, did } → { cid, url }
- `GET /api/web3storage/credentials/:did` → { data: [] }
- `DELETE /api/web3storage/credentials/:did` → { success }
- `GET /api/web3storage/status` → config + spaces info

### Web client configuration

Set the base URL for the web app to reach the service:

```


Or set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` as a fallback. The web client (`apps/web/service/identityService.ts`) will use these to call the service.
